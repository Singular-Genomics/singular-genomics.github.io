# :material-file: G4X Data
#### Output reference and analysis import guides.  

The G4X produces multi-modal output containing tables, images, arrays and annotated matrices for single-cell analysis.
The files found in the output directory are compatible with popular Python libraries from the [`scverse`](https://github.com/scverse) ecosystem, like `scanpy`, `rapids-singlecell`, `squidpy`, and `spatial-data`, and, if you prefer working in R, can be easily imported into [`Seurat`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).

#### In this section you will find:

+ details on the [G4X output](./g4x_output.md) files and their organization
+ guides on [importing](./data_import.md) G4X data into popular analysis tools in Python and R

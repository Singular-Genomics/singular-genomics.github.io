<!-- #### Welcome to Singular-Genomics Docs.  -->

These pages provide documentation, example workflows, and helper tools for analyzing, and post-processing data generated by the [**G4X spatial sequencer**](https://www.singulargenomics.com/g4x).

### Post-processing tools and helper models for G4X-data  

With [G4X-helpers](https://docs.singulargenomics.com/G4X-helpers/) we provide an open-source toolkit for common post-processing tasks — such as applying custom segmentations or adding your own labels to the [G4X-viewer](https://docs.singulargenomics.com/G4X-viewer/). You can access its core features from the command-line interface (CLI) and additionally import it as a standalone Python package to interact with your data.

#### In this section, you can:

+ learn how to [install](https://docs.singulargenomics.com/G4X-helpers/installation/) G4X-helpers on your system
+ get started with [using](https://docs.singulargenomics.com/G4X-helpers/usage/) the command line interface (CLI)
+ find a description of its [CLI features](https://docs.singulargenomics.com/G4X-helpers/features/)

### Explore and visualize your G4X-data  

The G4X-viewer is a Python-based, multi-purpose, interactive viewer specifically designed to help you explore your G4X-data. The G4X-viewer is accessible through our [website](https://g4x-viewer.singulargenomics.com) or can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/Singular-Genomics/G4X-viewer) as a standalone application and hosted locally.

#### In this section, you can:

+ find [resources](https://docs.singulargenomics.com/G4X-viewer/resources) to learn how to navigate your data with the G4X-viewer

### Reference documentation for G4X-output files  

The G4X produces multi-modal output containing tables, images, arrays and annotated matrices for single-cell analysis.
The files found in the output directory are compatible with popular Python libraries from the [`scverse`](https://github.com/scverse) ecosystem, like `scanpy`, `rapids-singlecell`, `squidpy`, and `spatial-data`, and, if you prefer working in R, can be easily imported into [`Seurat`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).

#### In this section, you will find:

+ details on the [G4X-output](./g4x_data/g4x_output.md) files and their organization
+ guides on [importing](./g4x_data/data_import.md) G4X-data into popular analysis tools in Python and R 

<br>

### Get started analyzing your data  

G4X Tutorials are a collection of example workflows that demonstrate how to analyze G4X-data using popular Python and R libraries. These tutorials cover a wide range of topics, from basic data import and visualization to advanced analysis techniques.

#### In this section, you can:

+ learn how to [plot spatial](./g4x_tutorials/plot_spatial.md) tissue information from the G4X-data
+ generate novel nuclear or cytoplasmic [segmentations](./g4x_tutorials/segment_data.md) with popular models
